This is also a great benefit for design - real mirror is always great in any bathroom and no worries about \"how to hide the TV\" and \"whether it fits my bathroom design\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We supply Bathroom TVs with back box and it's installed into opening in the wall first. After that the TV is inserted into the black box and sealed. Finally you get a very nice installation and TV front looks just like a slim glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One important advantage of out Bathroom TVs is that it has detachable back panel for easy service. Most of other models in the market has sealed case so there is actually no way to open it when something goes wrong. We have improved our case and developed waterproof detachable back panel that can be opened and closed by customer without having special tools or knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All series have invisible vibration speakers. They are fixed inside the TV on the inner glass (mirror) surface and generate the sound by making the glass itself shaking. We believe you will enjoy this feature a lot, new TVs are more easily to clean (no holes for speakers) and sound (middle and bass range) is quality better!</p>\r\n"

        value: "<h2>EMBEDDABLE KITCHEN TELEVISIONS FOR GOOD PRICE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 50% of the households worldwide have more than 2 TV sets and no doubt that TV in the Kitchen is common and popular now. One reason is to have entertainment for kids, the whole family (if you don't want to bring your dinner to the living room) or a party that often ends up in the Kitchen. Another important benefit is to have some company in the Kitchen when we are alone while cooking or eating. TV can help a lot to break this lonely silence and make your day or evening better. That's why we think that Kitchen TV is almost like necessity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitchen televisions are just regular TVs for it's functionality and work the same as others. What it is important in the Kitchen, it is the right screen size and the right place for the TV. It's not easy often to find a good place and the right height to hinge the TV. Of course most popular way to hinge a TV is to purchase a regular consumer TV (from 13” to 27”) and to hinge it on a wall or put upon a shelve or fridge. But does it look good and is it convenient to watch with your head up? When you spend a considerable time and amount of money on your Kitchen's design, furniture and appliances why not to have the TV that will fit your kitchen and your needs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noticed that some of our customers ordered our TVs for Bathroom and installed it in their Kitchens. They installed it in the wall (splashback) or into kitchen cabinet facade (though there was no special mounting those days). After talking to them, discussing with Kitchen furniture factories and gathering market information we proposed 2 line-ups and 2 solutions for your perfect Kitchen TV:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by build-in appliance development we designed a special Kitchen TV type – Cabinet Door TV that can be easily integrated in a Kitchen cabinet and will fit the design perfectly. See more details in our catalog:&nbsp;<u><a href=\"/catalog/kitchen-tvs/cabinet-door-tv\">Cabinet Door TV</a></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any Kitchen has a splashback and it's a good place for the TV installation. So we show our Bathroom TVs for your convenience as Kitchen Splashback TVs since they perfectly fit this application due to in-wall installation, real glass surface and waterproof design. See available sizes and colors here:&nbsp;<u><a href=\"/catalog/kitchen-tvs/splashback-tv\">Splashback TV</a></u></p>\r\n"

        value: "<p>Mirror TVs or Magic Mirror TVs are getting more and more popular due to its luxury design and mirror functionality. When the screen is off – you just have a regular mirror, your tv is vanished out of the mirror when it's on – it's a TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does it work?<br />\r\nMagic Mirror effect is provided by semi-transparent mirror glass that reflects the light when the screen is off but transmits the light of the screen when it's on. For good mirror TV performance, there should be the right balance of reflective and transmitting rate. When we increase transparency of the glass we get better TV performance (better image) but worse mirror performance (worse reflection and some internal elements behind the glass can be seen), so the semi-transparent mirror is one key important aspect. Another key important aspect is the LCD/LED panel. Original brightness of the screen is reduced by semi-transparent mirror by 30-60% so the screens for Mirror TVs should have the higher brightness to compare with regular consumer monitors to compensate this reduce. Contrast and colors are also distorted by the mirror that's why it's not easy technically to find the right combination (magic mirror + LCD/LED panel) and it's also more expansive than regular TV models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know a lot about this “balance” and now we use different mirror type and different LCD/LED panels for each size for better real performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course it's real glass and not acrylic used for our Mirror TVs. So you can be sure it will keep perfect appearance for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For safety concern we only use tempered safety glass for our standard Mirror TVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WATERPROOF MIRROR TVS FOR BATHROOM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Bathroom Mirror TVs are perfectly fit any bathroom's interior. You get real glass mirror with all the functions of modern TV. Why is this tv called vanishing mirror tv?&nbsp;We are sure you will enjoy Magic Mirror effect: the screen disappears when it's off and it looks just like a regular mirror.

        value: "<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>2019&nbsp;</span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">AVEL TVs model range includes 2 series:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">1. In-Wall TVs</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This series includes the following screen size: <strong>23.8” / 27” / 32” / 43” / 47” / 55”, 75”</strong> size is being developed and will be launched in Q3. The series includes 3 TV types:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Mirror TV screen finish</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">. This kind is also called <strong>Magic Mirror TV</strong> due to vanishing screen feature. TV looks like a plain mirror when the screen is off and turns to a TV by pressing a button. Our latest semi-transparent mirror has optimized optical performance (reflectance / transmittance rate), we are pretty sure we find the best possible balance and mirror color. All Mirror TVs are completely waterproof and passed IPX4 test, the certificate was issued accordingly. Small and medium sizes of Mirror TVs are installed in Bathrooms in most of the cases, that’s why we must make sure our TVs are water resistant and can work well in wet and humid environment. IPX4 standard means our TVs are protected against splashing of water from any direction (including the back of the TV and cable connection ports area). Front of our TVs is a plain real mirror, we use special vibration speakers to get rid of holes for the sound from speakers. So, the front of our TVs is completely water resistant and can be installed in a shower or other area where the water can be sprayed on the screen directly. Waterproof ranking will be increased to IP66 when the TV is installed in a wall (recess) and sealed properly. Big size Mirror TVs (43” and up) are often installed in Living rooms, Bedrooms, Terrace and other areas as a premium interior solution that helps to get rid of black square spot of a regular TV. Mirror itself is well known as a space increasing surface and can fit well most of design concepts.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">White Frame screen finish. </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">The second screen finish type is called “White Frame”. We use a special type of <strong>OptiWhite</strong> glass to reach the true white color without a hint of green tone that always exists in a regular glass. All White Frame TVs has <strong>touch control buttons</strong> on the front as a backup of remote control’s functions. White glass will fit well swimming pool or SPA areas and can be used an outstanding in-wall TV without any visible cables. No visible thickness, no dust on the back, no visible cables – these are important advantages of our In-Wall series. White Frame glass of all size AVEL TVs is a <strong>safety tempered glass</strong>, even if it got broken – there will be only small pieces that can not make any harm. That’s why this series can also be used in children’s rooms with no worries about the safety. Despite regular TVs, LED panel of AVEL TVs is protected and can not be easily damaged or broken. Of course, White Frame TVs are water resistant – just like Mirror TV series described above.<br />\r\n\t<!--[endif]--></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. Open Frame TVs</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This series of TVs was specially made to fulfill <strong>customized projects</strong> requests with big size mirrors. Usually a big mirror is ordered locally in the country of destination (where the project is being releasing) – it helps to reduce shipping costs and the risk of mirror damage. TV part includes metal back box, metal frame and the TV itself. Depending on the project specification, the final project can be waterproof (metal frame shall be sealed properly to the customized mirror in this case) or non-waterproof if there is no need (metal frame sealing can be skipped in this case). Big mirrors that are tailor-made to fit the interior precisely with a hidden TV are always unique and amazing projects. We have many examples both in commercial and home interiors. Open Frame TVs can be installed in beauty / hairdressing salons, lobbies, luxury hotels bathrooms; or at home above the fireplace or other location both in classic or modern interior.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n"
